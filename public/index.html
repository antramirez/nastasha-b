    <meta name="description" content="Nastasha B. is a persona that cannot be detailed in a typical three sentenced biographical paragraph. Her story takes comfort in that of a never-ending novel in which the plot evolves daily. Although inexplicable, her unembellished lyrics topped off with her harmonious melodies serve as a pathway into her everchanging thoughts."/>
